Title: Use of a NoSQL database for the system's data storage

Status: Accepted

Context: The system needs to store and retrieve large amounts of unstructured data with high scalability and availability requirements. The traditional relational database systems have limitations in handling such requirements. Therefore, the development team has considered using a NoSQL database solution.

Decision: The team has decided to use a NoSQL database for the system's data storage. The specific database solution chosen is MongoDB due to its ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data, its scalability, and its ability to handle distributed environments.

Rationale: The team has evaluated several options, including using a relational database, a document database, or a key-value store. After analyzing the requirements and constraints of the system, the team has concluded that a NoSQL database solution would be more suitable due to its ability to handle unstructured data and to scale horizontally. MongoDB was selected as it has a proven track record in such scenarios and provides a flexible data model that can accommodate future changes in data structures.

Alternatives Considered:

-   Relational database systems such as MySQL and PostgreSQL
-   Document databases such as Couchbase and RavenDB
-   Key-value stores such as Redis and Riak

Consequences:

-   MongoDB has a steeper learning curve compared to traditional relational databases, which may require additional training and resources.
-   The team needs to ensure that the data is properly modeled and indexed to optimize query performance.
-   The team needs to manage consistency and durability concerns since NoSQL databases may sacrifice some of these guarantees for scalability and availability.

Overall, the decision to use MongoDB as the system's data storage solution was made after careful consideration of the requirements, alternatives, and potential consequences. The ADR will be stored in a central repository and used as a reference point for future design changes, reviews, and discussions.
