The Project Folder forms part of [[The PARA Method]]. 

The Projects folder is a place to store all the information and materials related to your ongoing projects. A project is any task or goal that requires multiple steps or actions to complete, and may involve multiple people, resources, or deadlines.

The Projects folder is typically organized into subfolders, with each subfolder representing a different project. Within each subfolder, you might have documents, notes, images, files, or other materials related to the project. You might also include sub-subfolders for specific stages or aspects of the project, such as research, planning, execution, or review.

The Projects folder serves as a central repository for all the information and materials related to your projects, and helps you to stay organized, focused, and on track. By having all your project-related materials in one place, you can easily review your progress, identify next steps, and collaborate with others who are involved in the project.

To use the Projects folder effectively, it's important to regularly review and update the contents of each subfolder, and to keep the subfolders and files organized in a consistent and logical manner. You might also want to establish a system for tracking project status, milestones, and deadlines, and for assigning tasks and responsibilities to team members or collaborators.

By using the Projects folder, you can improve your project management skills, reduce stress and overwhelm, and ensure that your projects are completed on time and to the best of your ability.
