The Project Folder forms part of [[PARA Method]]. 

Areas, from a solution architect's perspective, represent the key domains or components of a system that require continuous attention and management. These areas encompass various aspects of the system, such as security, infrastructure, data management, and application development. Unlike specific projects, which have clear objectives and deadlines, areas involve ongoing responsibilities that ensure the stability, scalability, and performance of the overall system.

In the context of solution architecture, create separate folders or documentation for each area to store related design documents, best practices, guidelines, and any other relevant resources. Regularly update and maintain these folders, as they serve as a valuable reference for both current and future projects, helping maintain the coherence and efficiency of the system architecture.
