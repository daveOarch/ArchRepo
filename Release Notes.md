## Version 3.0

Version 3.0 comes with a major upgrade. One of Obsidians super power features, perhaps it's best, is the Graph so in this updated ArchVault will use the power of the Graph and Tags more and use fewer folders.

Using fewer folders has advantages in that it's difficult to create duplicates of files and it become harder to misplace them.

This also means that from the outset knowledge will be found using the search tools, tags, graph or Dataview which are good habits because as the amount of knowledge you accumulate grows your existing workflow will not need to adjust as much. Less does indeed mean more!
## Tags
Tags have a refined purpose in that they are used 

For example, words like 'AI' or the Project you are working on make great categories.

#### Project Tags
Project Tags come in two variants 
- Project Name
- Project Phase

## Backlinks
Backlinks are the best way to link items of knowledge together.

For example, if you use a Backlink using words such as 'ChatGPT' or 'AI' which could encompass lots of notes it will make the Graph messy and difficult to navigate, so makes sense to use them as Tags instead. 
# New Folders 
## Data
The Data Folder is now default for new files created in the Vault.

The intention is that the Data folder will hold the majority of the files of knowledge that will be accumulated over time.
## Annex
Is a set of folders that contain items that support the vault, such as,
- Templates - for Markdown files
- Attachments - images and so on that are attached to a Markdown page
- AI Prompts - AI Prompts templates used by the Text Generator plugin.
