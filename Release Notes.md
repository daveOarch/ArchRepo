## Version 3.0 Overview

In our new Version 3.0, we've made significant changes to leverage Obsidian's Graph, a standout feature. With this update, ArchVault will rely more on the Graph and Tags, reducing the dependency on folders. The whole Vault has only eight folders and this number is likely to go down in future version.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced chances of duplicating files.
- Minimised risk of misplacing files.
- As your collection of notes grows, you won't have to change your workflow much. It's all about optimising with less!

## Using Tags

Tags are now more focused. They're great for categories like 'AI' or specific projects you're working on.

#### Projects and Tags
Tags related to projects can reflect:
- The Project's Name.
- The current Phase of the project.

## Backlinks and How to Use Them

Backlinks are ideal for connecting related knowledge pieces. However, using broad terms like 'ChatGPT' or 'AI' as backlinks can clutter the Graph, so it's recommended to use such terms as Tags.

## New Folder Structure

### 1. Data Folder
- This is the primary folder for new files.
- It's designed to hold most of your knowledge-based files over time.

### 2. Annex
This folder holds supportive content for the vault:
- **Templates** - Markdown file templates.
- **Attachments** - Items like images linked to a Markdown page.
- **AI Prompts** - Templates for the Text Generator plugin.

### Changes Made to Folders

- Several folders have been removed for simplicity.
- Folders like "Projects", "Areas", "Landscapes", "Data Stores", "Inbox", "Logs", and "Standards" have either been archived or their content has been moved to the Data folder.
- Folders have been relocated and renamed for better organization: 
  - References\_Prompts is now Annex\AI Prompts
  - References\_Attachment\ is now Annex\Attachment
  - References\_Templates is now Annex\Templates
