An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures the context, rationale, and consequences of a specific architecture decision made in the development of a system. It is a concise and clear record of the reasoning behind the decision and how it fits into the overall architecture of the system.

An ADR typically includes information such as the title of the decision, a brief description of the problem or issue being addressed, the proposed solution, the rationale for the decision, the alternatives that were considered, and any trade-offs or risks associated with the decision.

The purpose of an ADR is to provide transparency and traceability in the decision-making process and to help maintain a consistent and cohesive architecture over time. It allows architects, developers, and stakeholders to understand the reasoning behind decisions made and to evaluate the impact of those decisions on the overall system architecture.

ADRs are typically maintained in a centralized repository and can be used as a reference point for future decisions, reviews, and discussions. They are particularly useful in larger projects or organizations where multiple teams or individuals may be involved in making architecture decisions and where it is important to maintain a clear and consistent vision of the system's architecture over time.
