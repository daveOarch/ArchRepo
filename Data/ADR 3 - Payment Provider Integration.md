### Status: Accepted

### Context:

We need to decide on the payment provider for the ecommerce website. We have several options to consider, including using a third-party payment gateway or building our own payment system. We need to consider factors such as integration complexity, transaction fees, security, and customer experience.

### Decision:

We have decided to use a third-party payment gateway for the ecommerce website. Specifically, we will integrate with a reputable payment provider that offers a robust and secure payment processing system. This will enable us to provide a seamless and secure payment experience for our customers, while also reducing the development and maintenance efforts required for building our own payment system.

### Consequences:

By using a third-party payment gateway, we will have to pay transaction fees for each payment processed. However, this will provide us with a reliable and secure payment processing system that can handle various payment methods and protect against fraud and chargebacks.
