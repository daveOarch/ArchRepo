As a customer looking to purchase a product on the ecommerce website, I want to be able to view detailed product information so that I can make an informed purchase decision. I expect to be able to view high-quality product images from multiple angles, read a detailed description of the product features and benefits, and access technical specifications if relevant. Additionally, I expect to be able to see the product's availability and delivery options, along with any promotions or discounts that may apply. Furthermore, I expect to be able to read reviews and ratings from other customers who have purchased the product, to get a sense of their experiences and opinions.
