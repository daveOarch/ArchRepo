Functional requirements refer to the specific features and capabilities that a software or system must possess to meet the needs of its users and perform its intended functions. These requirements typically describe the tasks that the system must perform, the data that it must store or manipulate, and the interactions it must have with other systems or users.

Functional requirements are often expressed as use cases or user stories and can include details such as input and output requirements, performance standards, security and accessibility needs, and compatibility with other software or hardware systems. They form the basis of a software or system's design and development, as they outline the specific functionalities that must be built and tested to ensure that the software or system meets the user's needs and objectives.
