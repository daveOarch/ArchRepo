# Choosing a Frontend Framework for WebApp Y

## Context and Problem Statement

WebApp Y requires a reactive frontend with capabilities to handle large datasets. Which frontend framework best fits our needs?

## Decision Drivers

* Performance
* Learning curve
* Ecosystem & community support
* Interoperability with our backend

## Considered Options

* React
* Vue.js
* Angular

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "TBD", because the decision is still proposed and under discussion.

### Consequences

To be determined post decision.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### React

* Good, because of its vast community.
* Good, because of its component-based architecture.
* Neutral, because some team members are unfamiliar with it.
* Bad, because it's only a library and might need additional tools.

### Vue.js

* Good, because of its simplicity and ease of integration.
* Good, because it is lightweight.
* Neutral, because we have limited expertise on the team.
* Bad, because its ecosystem is not as expansive as React's.

### Angular

* Good, because it's a full-fledged framework.
* Good, because of its two-way data binding.
* Neutral, because it has a steeper learning curve.
* Bad, because it might be overkill for our needs.
