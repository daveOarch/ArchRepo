# Introduction

ArchVault was conceived in response to a common frustration: the inefficiency and impermanence of traditional documentation methods.

Gone are the days when we would spend countless hours, days, or even weeks drafting documents, only to have them buried within seemingly infinite Word files and lost in the labyrinth of SharePoint folders. It's akin to pouring immense effort into a project, only to discard it, never to be seen again!

Over time, memories fade, and employees move on. The valuable knowledge they've amassed often goes with them, slipping away into oblivion. In the absence of a systematic approach, we find ourselves desperately searching, sometimes stumbling upon relevant documents but lacking context. It becomes a challenge to comprehend the interconnectedness of various facets like technology, security, and data. Moreover, deciphering the rationale behind certain decisions, understanding constraints, or grasping the thought processes becomes near-impossible. Further complicating matters are enterprise software solutions that, while serving specific purposes, fail to integrate seamlessly with other crucial information hubs or adapt to evolving knowledge.

Enter Obsidian – a glimmer of hope in what is clearly chaotic. While Obsidian offers a promising solution, its initial blank slate can be daunting. Recognising this, I developed ArchVault. My goal is to collaboratively craft with the community a tool that empowers Solution Architects like us, streamlining our workflows and ensuring our insights remain accessible and contextualised.

# Resilience of Text-Based Formats

While there's no obligation to use Obsidian, the beauty of these files lies in their markdown format. This ensures ease of conversion, fitting seamlessly into whichever tool you prefer. Markdown's inherent flexibility and simplicity are its key strengths.

A word of advice from my experience: while digital formats evolve, text-based file formats, such as Markdown, have demonstrated a resilience against the ravages of time. My tenure with a 200-year-old organisation underscored this wisdom. Historically, information was penned in books, predominantly in English. The significance? Even today, such straightforward, universally accessible formats can be effortlessly read and comprehended, proprietary data formats eventually lead to technical debt at best and a file that cannot be read at worst.

Today's evolving tech landscape offers a pertinent analogy. While certain foundational aspects of the systems we build—like their structure —might stand the test of time, other facets, such as security protocols or UI adjustments and of course data, will undergo continual transformation, which will never stop. Yet, amidst this evolution, we acknowledge a shift: contemporary systems lean towards compartmentalisation rather than complete overhauls. The legacy of enduring, text-based formats complements this shift, ensuring continuity and understanding across what will be generations, if and only if we do our jobs well now!
