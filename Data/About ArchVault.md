# Introduction

It has become a norm to write documentation in Markdown next to the code in a Git based repository. What hasn't become a standard is the structure of the documentation. 

ArchVault is a template for storing knowledge not just about the code but what is the code at the centre of? and how, why and what it is connected to?

Developers are efficient with their time, they understand its value intrinsically, this is at the centre of why they can and should resist writing documentation, it shouldn't be because it's a box that needs to be ticked but because we know it won't have a lot of value if its hard to find and hard to maintain. 

With ArchVault the knowledge you capture will have value because of the relationships it has. You will enjoy writing document because it will become part of the creative process, because it will have value and meaning. 

What ArchVault isn't is a bunch of folders or naming conventions for files. ArchVault has eight folders max and that's too many, you will be able to remember what they are all for. Tags and Backlinks create the structure, they help a knowledge file describe itself. 

Tags tells us what group this knowledge file belongs to 

Backlinks tells us what a knowledge file is related to. 

Like a map, knowledge should be found be triangulation not a rigid structure that where a file could be duplicated multiple times. Git is great at version control so let it do that, don't put a version number in a file name ever again! 



ArchVault was conceived in response to a common frustration: the inefficiency and impermanence of traditional documentation methods.





# Resilience of Text-Based Formats

While there's no obligation to use Obsidian, the beauty of these files lies in their markdown format. This ensures ease of conversion, fitting seamlessly into whichever tool you prefer. Markdown's inherent flexibility and simplicity are its key strengths.

A word of advice from my experience: while digital formats evolve, text-based file formats, such as Markdown, have demonstrated a resilience against the ravages of time. My tenure with a 200-year-old organisation underscored this wisdom. Historically, information was penned in books, predominantly in English. The significance? Even today, such straightforward, universally accessible formats can be effortlessly read and comprehended, proprietary data formats eventually lead to technical debt at best and a file that cannot be read at worst.

Today's evolving tech landscape offers a pertinent analogy. While certain foundational aspects of the systems we build—like their structure —might stand the test of time, other facets, such as security protocols or UI adjustments and of course data, will undergo continual transformation, which will never stop. Yet, amidst this evolution, we acknowledge a shift: contemporary systems lean towards compartmentalisation rather than complete overhauls. The legacy of enduring, text-based formats complements this shift, ensuring continuity and understanding across what will be generations, if and only if we do our jobs well now!
