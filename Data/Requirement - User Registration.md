As a first-time customer, I want to create an account on the ecommerce website, so that I can access personalized features and checkout faster. I expect to provide my name, email address, and password to complete the registration process. Once registered, I should be able to update my profile information, such as my shipping and billing address, view my order history, and receive promotional emails or newsletters. If I forget my password, I should be able to reset it through a secure verification process.
