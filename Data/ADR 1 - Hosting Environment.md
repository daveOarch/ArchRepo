### Status: Accepted

### Context:

We need to decide on the hosting environment for the ecommerce website. We have several options to consider, including using a cloud provider, a dedicated server, or a shared hosting service. We need to consider factors such as scalability, reliability, security, and cost.

### Decision:

We have decided to use a cloud provider for hosting the ecommerce website. Specifically, we will use a managed cloud hosting service that offers high availability, automatic scaling, and advanced security features. This will allow us to easily scale the website as needed to handle increasing traffic, ensure high uptime, and protect against security threats.

### Consequences:

By using a cloud provider for hosting the website, we will have to pay ongoing hosting fees. However, this will provide us with a scalable and reliable hosting environment that can be easily managed and secured.
