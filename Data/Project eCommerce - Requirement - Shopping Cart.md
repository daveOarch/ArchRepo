As a customer looking to purchase multiple products on the ecommerce website, I want to be able to add items to my shopping cart so that I can keep track of my purchases and easily proceed to checkout. I expect to be able to view my cart contents at any time, with a summary of the total cost including taxes, shipping, and any applicable discounts or promotions. Additionally, I expect to be able to modify the quantity or remove items from my cart, and to receive real-time updates on the availability of each item. If I leave the website without completing my purchase, I expect my cart to be saved so that I can resume my shopping later.
