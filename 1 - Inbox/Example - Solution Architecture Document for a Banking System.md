This document provides an overview of the Solution Architecture for a Banking System. The purpose of the Solution Architecture document is to provide an overview of how the system should be structured, what technologies are used, and how the system will work. This document serves as a blueprint for the project and will guide the implementation process.

The Solution Architecture document outlines the overall design of the system and explains the core components, their interactions, and interfaces. It gives an in-depth description of the architecture, including a high-level overview of the architecture, process models, and use cases. It also provides a detailed explanation of the system’s data flows, data models, APIs, and security features.

The document also outlines various integration points with other systems, such as third-party accounting software. In addition, it outlines the steps taken to ensure compliance with regulations and banking industry standards. It also describes general guidelines for development, testing, and deployment.

The Solution Architecture document provides a clear understanding of the system’s design, enabling faster development and deployment cycles. It serves as a guide for developers and a reference for stakeholders. All stakeholders should review this document before proceeding with the project.

A. Description of the System Architecture 
The Banking System Architecture is designed to handle all aspects of banking operations, including customer management, account management and transactions. It provides the platform for an integrated, reliable and secure system to enable customers to interact with the financial institution. The system architecture is designed to provide a combination of user-facing applications, back-end services, data management, and security.

B. System Components and Interfaces 
The system components include user-facing applications such as web and mobile banking interfaces, a customer relationship management (CRM) system, a payment gateway, and an account management system. The user-facing applications are integrated with the back-end services including transaction processing, fraud detection, data analysis, and reporting. Interfaces with external systems such as financial institutions and other third parties are also necessary components of the system architecture.

C. Security Considerations 
The system architecture must ensure the security of customer information and transactions. This includes measures to protect customer identities and data from unauthorized access and use. Security measures also include encryption, authentication techniques, and other security protocols.

D. Data Storage Requirements 
The system architecture must provide for reliable and secure data storage for customer information, transactions, and other data related to the banking operations. Data must be stored in a manner that ensures that it can be easily accessed and updated by authorized users, while ensuring that data access is limited to authorized users only. Data must also be stored in a manner that meets required privacy and security regulations.

A. Performance Requirements: The banking system must be designed to scale and grow to meet future demand with minimal effort, incorporating appropriate load balancing and fault tolerance. System performance must meet SLA targets of response times less than 5ms for all operations. 

B. Usability Requirements: The user interface must be intuitive and easy to use. System must include user and system training materials, and provide a user-friendly help feature and platform for customer service support. 

C. Reliability Requirements: The banking system must be designed in an active/active DR configuration with minimal downtime; system downtime must not exceed 5 minutes in a 24 hour period.    

D. Regulatory Compliance Requirements: The banking system must comply with applicable regulations as determined by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other applicable regulators. 

E. Other Functional Requirements: System must include functionality necessary for core banking operations such as account opening, payments and transfers, transaction processing, etc., as well as features for customer relationship management (CRM), analytics, reporting, and security. 

F. Other Non-functional Requirements: System must achieve an RTO of less than 1 hour, an RPO of less than 5 minutes, and an MTTR of less than 10 minutes in the event of a system outage.  

G. Budgetary Considerations: The total cost of ownership (TCO) for the banking system over the next five years must not exceed £1 million in Opex per annum. 

H. Quality Assurance Criteria: System must pass a battery of tests defined by both internal and external quality assurance standards prior to deployment.
