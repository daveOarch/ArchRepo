# Arch Vault
Knowledge Management for Technical Architects

This is a project to create an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) Vault to aid all types of technical architecture such as Solution, Software and Data by using automation.

The main idea is that this Vault can be open and used immediately after downloading or cloning  it.

**Recommendation** - Please update the Community Plugins before use.

**Please note** - Double square brackets < [[]] > are the Obsidian syntax for a bi-directional link and therefore will not work when viewed from GitHub 

## Installation
1.  You can either clone this repo or download via one of the releases. The file will be saved to your computer's downloads folder.
    
2.  Open the downloads folder on your computer, and locate the downloaded Obsidian vault file. It should be saved as a .zip file.
    
3.  Extract the contents of the .zip file to a location of your choice on your computer. You can do this by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Extract all" or using a file compression software like WinZip or 7-Zip.
    
4.  After extracting the contents of the .zip file, navigate to the location where the vault was extracted. You should see a folder with the same name as the Obsidian vault.
    
5.  Open the Obsidian app on your computer.
    
6.  Click on "Open another vault" from the left sidebar menu of the Obsidian app.
    
7.  In the "Open Vault" window, navigate to the location where you extracted the vault files, and select the folder with the same name as the Obsidian vault.
    
8.  Click "Open" to open the Obsidian vault in the app.

## Multiple Users
This Vault has been specifically design with mulitple users in mind that share the same vault using Git.

## Obsidian Markdown Format
The Markdown written in this Vault is intended for use in Obsidian and not GitHub and so features such as bi-directional links will not work.


## What are the 'What is' files?
The 'What is' files are used to explain what certain parts of the Vault are used for.
A good place to start is the [[MoC - What Is files]] which is a FAQ of sorts.

## Folders

### Root Folders
Root Folders all have a number before them so they stay in the PARA order.

### _ Folders
Underscores are placed as the first character for some folders as they are used in the configuration of this vault.


## Map of Contents / MoC
MoC - prefix for Map of Content files. The [[What is - Map of Content]] explains in greater depth.
