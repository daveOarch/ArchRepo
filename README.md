# Arch Vault
Knowledge Management for Technical Architects

This is a project to create an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) Vault to aid all types of technical architecture such as Solution, Software and Data by using automation.

The idea is that you can open and use the Vault immediately after downloading it.

**Recommendation** - Please update the Plugins before use.

## Multiple Users
This Vault has been specifically design with mulitple users in mind that share the same vault using Git.

## Obsidian Markdown Format
The Markdown written in this Vault is intended for use in Obsidian and not GitHub and so features such as bi-directional links will not work.


## What are the 'What is' files?
The 'What is' files are used to explain what certain parts of the Vault are used for.
A good place to start is the [[MoC - What Is files]] which is a FAQ of sorts.

## Folders

### Root Folders
Root Folders all have a number before them so they stay in the PARA order.

### _ Folders
Underscores are placed as the first character for some folders as they are used in the configuration of this vault.


## Map of Contents / MoC
MoC - prefix for Map of Content files. The [[What is - Map of Content]] explains in greater depth.
