A Technical Reference Model (TRM) is a type of reference architecture that provides a framework for designing and implementing technology solutions. It is a high-level blueprint or conceptual model that describes the various technology layers, components, and services that are necessary to build a comprehensive and integrated technology infrastructure.

The TRM defines a standard set of technology components and services that are used to build and integrate IT systems. It includes a set of recommended standards, guidelines, and best practices for the design and implementation of technology solutions. The TRM typically consists of a set of abstraction layers, each of which represents a specific area of technology functionality, such as hardware, software, networking, security, and data management.

The main purpose of a TRM is to provide a common language and framework for communication and collaboration among different technology stakeholders, such as system architects, designers, developers, and vendors. By using a TRM, organizations can improve the consistency, interoperability, and scalability of their technology solutions, and reduce the costs and risks associated with technology integration and deployment.
