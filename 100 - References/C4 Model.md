The C4 model is a visual notation for representing and communicating the architecture of software systems. It was created by Simon Brown, a software architecture consultant, as a way to help software development teams to describe and understand the structure of their software systems at different levels of abstraction.

The C4 model consists of four levels of abstraction:

1.  Context: This level provides a high-level overview of the system and its environment, including its users, other systems it interacts with, and any technical or business constraints.
    
2.  Containers: This level focuses on the high-level components of the system, such as web servers, application servers, databases, and other services that make up the system. It provides a clear understanding of how the system is decomposed into smaller, more manageable parts.
    
3.  Components: This level deals with the individual building blocks of the system, such as classes, modules, or microservices. It provides a detailed understanding of the internal workings of the system, including how the components interact with each other and how they implement the functionality of the system.
    
4.  Code: This level provides a detailed view of the code itself, including how the individual components are implemented and how they interact with each other.
    

The C4 model is a simple yet powerful way to communicate the architecture of software systems, allowing software development teams to understand and communicate the structure of their systems at different levels of abstraction.
